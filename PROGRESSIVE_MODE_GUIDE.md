# Progressive Mode System - Complete Implementation

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Mode Selection UI**
- Click "Play" button → Shows mode selection screen
- Two modes available:
  - **PROGRESSIVE**: Earn polys, unlock tech via tech tree
  - **ADVENTURE**: Classic mode with random powerups

### 2. **Progressive Mode Features**

#### **Poly Currency System**
- **Earn polys by:**
  - Killing enemies (stronger = more polys, scales with mob health)
  - Completing levels (50 + 10 per level cleared)
  
#### **PolyTree - Tech Unlocking**
- Press "PolyTree" button (only works in Progressive mode)
- Visual tech tree with branches showing dependencies
- **4 Tiers of Tech:**
  - Tier 1: Starter tech (50-100 polys)
  - Tier 2: Basic upgrades (125-150 polys)
  - Tier 3: Advanced upgrades (200-300 polys)
  - Tier 4: Elite upgrades (350-500 polys)

#### **Powerup System**
- **First powerup**: Random selection from ALL tech (so you can fight back)
- **After first powerup**: Only tech you've unlocked in PolyTree appears
- This forces strategic choices in the tech tree

### 3. **PolyTree UI**
- **Green nodes**: Tech you own (appears in powerups)
- **Yellow nodes**: Can purchase now (have polys + dependencies)
- **Gray nodes**: Locked (need dependencies or more polys)
- **Lines**: Show which tech is required before others
- Click yellow tech to purchase

## 🎮 How to Play Progressive Mode

1. **Start Game**
   - Click "Play" → Select "PROGRESSIVE"
   
2. **First Level**
   - Get first powerup (random, any tech) to start fighting
   - Kill enemies to earn polys
   - Complete level for bonus polys

3. **Between Levels/During Game**
   - Click "PolyTree" button
   - Buy tech with your polys
   - Build your preferred upgrade path

4. **Future Powerups**
   - Only show tech you've purchased
   - Forces planning and strategy

## 📊 Tech Tree Structure (Sample)

```
Tier 1 (Cheap Starters)
├── supply chain (50)
├── logistics (75)
└── gun sciences (100)
    │
Tier 2 (Basic Upgrades)
├── arsenal (150) ← requires gun sciences
├── active cooling (150) ← requires gun sciences
└── desublimated ammunition (125) ← requires logistics
    │
Tier 3 (Advanced)
├── integrated armament (250) ← requires arsenal
├── entanglement (200) ← requires arsenal
├── generalist (300) ← requires active cooling
└── specialist (300) ← requires gun sciences
    │
Tier 4 (Elite)
├── gun turret (400) ← requires desublimated ammunition
├── inertial frame (350) ← requires active cooling
└── automatic (500) ← requires inertial frame
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **index.html** - Added mode selection UI, PolyTree UI container
2. **js/simulation.js** - Added gameMode, polys, firstPowerUpSpawned tracking
3. **js/powerup.js** - Modified tech selection for progressive mode
4. **js/mob.js** - Added poly rewards on mob death
5. **js/level.js** - Added poly rewards on level complete
6. **js/polytree.js** - NEW FILE - Complete tech tree system

### Key Functions:
- `polyTree.init()` - Initialize progressive mode
- `polyTree.awardPolyForKill(mob)` - Give polys when mob dies
- `polyTree.awardPolyForLevel()` - Give polys when level completes
- `polyTree.buyTech(techId)` - Purchase tech from tree
- `polyTree.renderTree()` - Draw the tech tree UI

## 🎯 Game Balance

- **Mob kills**: ~1-10 polys (based on mob health)
- **Level completion**: 50 + (10 × levelsCleared) polys
- **Tier 1 tech**: 50-100 polys (affordable early)
- **Tier 4 tech**: 350-500 polys (endgame power)

## 🚀 What's Next?

You can now:
- Expand the tech tree with more tech
- Adjust poly costs for balance
- Add more tiers
- Customize the tree layout
- Add more visual effects to the PolyTree UI

Adventure mode works exactly as before - no changes to classic gameplay!
