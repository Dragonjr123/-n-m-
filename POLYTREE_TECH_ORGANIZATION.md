# PolyTree Tech Organization (Worst → Best)

## Overview
The tech tree is now organized by power level, from weakest utility tech to game-breaking elite tech. This creates a natural progression system where players start with cheap, situational upgrades and work toward powerful endgame abilities.

## Tier Structure

### **Tier 1: Weak/Situational Utility (25-75 polys)**
*Starting tech - low impact, situational use*

1. **supply chain** (25 polys) - Double ammo, basic utility
2. **catabolism** (30 polys) - Trade health for ammo (risky)
3. **desublimated ammunition** (40 polys) - 50% less ammo when crouching (niche)
4. **logistics** (50 polys) - 200% ammo but only current gun
5. **dead reckoning** (60 polys) - 30% damage when at rest
6. **gun sciences** (75 polys) - Spawn gun + tech frequency

**Philosophy**: Cheap, accessible, but limited impact. Good for early game survival.

### **Tier 2: Moderate Upgrades (100-200 polys)**
*Solid improvements with noticeable impact*

7. **active cooling** (100 polys) - 14% fire rate per gun
8. **gun turret** (120 polys) - 55% harm reduction when crouching
9. **arsenal** (150 polys) - 14% damage per gun
10. **inertial frame** (180 polys) - 66% fire rate but only at rest
11. **entanglement** (200 polys) - Reduce harm by 13% per gun

**Philosophy**: Clear benefits, requires planning. Good mid-game power spikes.

---

### **Tier 3: Strong Upgrades (250-400 polys)**
*Build-defining tech that shapes playstyle*

12. **integrated armament** (250 polys) - 22% damage, 1 gun only
13. **automatic** (300 polys) - Auto-fire at rest + 250% ammo
14. **specialist** (350 polys) - Spawn powerup per gun
15. **generalist** (400 polys) - 6 guns, auto-cycle

**Philosophy**: Significant power, requires commitment. Defines your strategy.

---

### **Tier 4: Elite/Game-Changing (500-800 polys)**
*Expensive, powerful, run-winning tech*

16. **matter manipulator** (500 polys) - Ultimate specialist payoff
17. **time dilation** (600 polys) - Extreme time manipulation
18. **wormhole** (700 polys) - Teleportation/mobility god mode
19. **vacuum decay** (800 polys) - Massive damage output

**Philosophy**: Endgame power fantasies. These should feel OP and earned.

## Dependency Chains

### **Gun Damage Path**
```
gun sciences → arsenal → integrated armament → vacuum decay
```
Pure damage scaling for single-gun specialists.

### **Fire Rate Path**
```
dead reckoning → inertial frame → automatic → time dilation
```
Maximize shots per second, stationary playstyle.

### **Multi-Gun Path**
```
gun sciences → active cooling → generalist → wormhole
```
Juggle many guns, versatile combat.

### **Specialist Path**
```
gun sciences → specialist → matter manipulator
```
Powerup generation and resource snowball.

### **Defensive Path**
```
desublimated ammunition → gun turret
```
Tankier, crouch-based gameplay.

## Balancing Philosophy

**Costs scale with power:**
- Tier 1: Easy to afford (1-2 levels)
- Tier 2: Requires planning (3-5 levels)
- Tier 3: Major investment (5-8 levels)
- Tier 4: Endgame goal (10+ levels)

**Dependencies create choices:**
- Can't rush to best tech
- Must invest in a "path"
- Different paths enable different playstyles

**Progressive mode strategy:**
- Early: Buy cheap Tier 1 tech to expand powerup pool
- Mid: Focus on one path (damage/speed/versatility)
- Late: Save for Tier 4 game-winners

## Future Expansion Ideas

- Add branching paths within tiers
- Create "prestige" tech that requires multiple Tier 4s
- Add synergy bonuses for owning related tech
- Special "ultimate" tier at 1000+ polys
